<p id="para-style">Thus, customer is a static structure variable of type account, whose members are assigned initial values. The first 
member (acct-no) is assigned the integer value 12345, the second member (acct-type) is assigned the character 'R I, 
the third member (name [ 801) is assigned the string John W. Smith ",and the fourth member (balance) is assigned the 
floating-point value 586.30. The last member is itself a structure that contains three integer members (month, day and 
year). Therefore, the last member of customer is assigned the integer values 5, 24 and 90.
</p>


<p>In this declaration customer is a 100-element array of structures. Hence, each element of customer is a separate 
structure of type account (i.e., each element of customer represents an individual customer record). 
Note that each structure of type account includes an array (name[80]) and another structure (date) as members. 
Thus, we have an array and a structure embedded within another structure, which is itself an element of an array. 
It is, of course, also permissible to define customer in a separate declaration, as shown below.
