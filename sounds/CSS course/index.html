<p>red to as members. 
This chapter is concerned with the use of structures within a C program. We will see how structures are 
defined, and how their individual members are accessed and processed within a program. The relationships 
between structures and pointers, arrays and functions will also be examined. 
Closely associated with the structure is the union, which also contains multiple members. Unlike a 
structure, however, the members of a union share the same storage area, even though the individual members 
may differ in type. Thus, a union permits several different data items to be stored in the same portion of the 
computerâ€™s memory at different times. We will see how unions are defined and utilized within a C program.

<p>In this declaration, struct is a required keyword; tag is a name that identifies structures of this type (i.e., 
structures having this composition); and member I, member 2, . . . , member m are individual member 
declarations. (Note: There is no formal distinction between a structure definition and a structure declurution; 
the terms are used interchangeably.) 
The individual members can be ordinary variables, pointers, arrays, or other structures. The member 
names within a particular structure must be distinct from one another, though a member name can be the same 
as the name of a variable that is defined outside of the structure. A storage class, however, cannot be assigned 
to an individual member, and individual members cannot be initialized within a structure type declaration. 
Once the composition of the structure has been defined, individual structure-type variables can be 
declared as follows</p>
